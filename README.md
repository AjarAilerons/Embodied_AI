If you have a chance to perhaps write more on what this might mean for kids and adults that’d be cool. 
For instance is saying please to Alexa appropriate? Debate!!

#### What's missing in AI?

* Phyisical: Things that we can touch are easier to understand and to connect with
* Tools to make it **accessible**: The best way to understand and demystify a new technology is to explore it and build it.(http://cognimates.me)
* Personality: Interacting with standardised systems may produce alienation, an organically perceived personality might help prevent this. 
* Emotional:
  * the most powerful kind of intelligence that we know of, human intelligence, is hard to conceive without emotions. 
  * emotions are a great way to relate to new things and that it’s easier to understand things we relate to.

#### Future developments of the project

* Personality: implementing an [internal state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine) so the AI develops an individual personality based on its interactions with the user. Possible implentation: 
  * a Markov chain model based on the [five factors personality model](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/mpe/2013/132735/)
  * a Markov chain model based on the [Jungian personality model](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1680/paper7.pdf)
  * non-markovian implementations


#### What does this mean for kids and adults?

For a AI to be emotional and to have its own personality means that
* it's more likely to be seamlessly integrated in the family dynamics
* it feels less of a alienating experience to interact with it


#### Possible use cases in a household environment 

* Helping cementing certain manners like saying *please*.
* The way kids behave towards their frieds is an indicator of their emotional state. The AI could be used as tool to unearth and prevent adverse situations a child might be quietly going through, ie. bullying at school.
* *Parental outsourcing, want a child but don't want to spend too much time with s/he? An AI can provide the attention you can't.*
