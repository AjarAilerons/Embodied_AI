Embodied AI

If you have a chance to perhaps write more on what this might mean for kids and adults thatâ€™d be cool. 
For instance is saying please to Alexa appropriate? Debate!!

###### What does this mean for kids and adults?

For a AI to be emotional and to have its own personality means that
* it's more likely to be seamlessly integrated in the family dynamics
* it feels less of a alienating experience to interact with it


###### Possible use cases

* Helping cementing certain manners like saying *please*.
* The way kids behave towards their frieds is an indicator of their emotional state. The AI could be used as tool to unearth and prevent adverse situations a child might be quietly going through, ie. bullying at school.
* `Parental outsourcing, want a child but don't want to spend too much time with s/he? An AI can provide the attention you can't.`
